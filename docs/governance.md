# EESSI Governance

EESSI recognises that formal governance is essential given the ambitions of the project, not just for EESSI
itself but also to those who would adopt EESSI and/or fund it's development.

EESSI is, therefore, in the process of adopting a formal governance model. To facilitate this process it has created an
_Interim Steering Committee_ whose role is to progress this adoption while also providing direction to the project.

## Members of the _Interim Steering Committee_

The members of the _Interim Steering Committee_ are listed below. Each member of the _Interim Steering Committee_ also
nominate an alternate should they not be able to attend a meeting of the commitee.
