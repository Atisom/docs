# EESSI Governance

## Motivation and goals
<!-- First, let's address the 'why'-->
The EESSI open source project was started by a small group of HPC engineers and support staff, working towards a common goal: a shared software stack of optimized software, that supports a wide range of systems. Collaboration was done based on implicit rules, and the group was small enough to easily reach consensus-based solutions. As the community grew, we have formalized the implicit rules for collaboration in this governance document, thus allowing for a structured and formalized way in which _all_ community members can contribute to the project and gain influence on it's direction.

The value of EESSI grows exponentially with two things: the amount of systems that make the EESSI software stack available, and the amount of software that is available in the EESSI software stack. Thus, the first goal of this governance is to make sure everyone in the community feels sufficiently included so that they are willing to contribute to EESSI (rather than build their own solution).

The second goal of this governance is to make clear how and by whom decisions in EESSI are taken. This is because _trust_ in this process is important, both to infrastructure providers making the EESSI software stack is available on their systems, as well as by end-users of the software. Note that this concerns both large decisions (e.g. which architectures to support) and small decisions (e.g. whether to accept a certain contribution to add software to EESSI).

To achieve both goals, our governance is based on the meritocracy governance model.<!-- Is this indeed what we want? We COULD be less open, and it COULD be better for the security aspect of things... --->

## Roles and Responsibilities

<!-- TODO make a chart similar to the governance map at https://ubuntu.com/community/governance ?

General note:
- All roles affecting security (Infrastructure maintainers, Code maintainers, Deployers, Builders): how do we ensure security?
- Should probably be a limited group of people, and at least 1 person in the current group should know the new person _personally_ before accepting into the group. Should probably state this explicitely in the governance

### Steering Committee

- Governance
- Arbitrage
- Consult on large technical decisions? Or does it take them? Or do we need a technical board?
- How is the steering committee composed (election?)
- How are people removed from the steering committee (next election? Step down? Unanimous vote by the others?)

### Code maintainers

- Github
- How does one get rights? Who assigns them? Who takes them away?
- How does one become code maintainer? How does one get removed from this group?

### Infrastructure maintainers

- Stratum 0, Stratum 1, build infrastructure
- Policy: we only ingest from infrastructured maintained by the Infrastructure maintainers

### Deployers

- Have the power to deploy software, i.e. tell the Stratum 0 to ingest software into the repository
- How does one get this right? How is it removed?

### Builders

### Contributors

### Users


EESSI recognises that formal governance is essential given the ambitions of the project, not just for EESSI
itself but also to those who would adopt EESSI and/or fund its development.

EESSI is, therefore, in the process of adopting a formal governance model. To facilitate this process it has created an
_Interim Steering Committee_ whose role is to progress this adoption while also providing direction to the project.

## Members of the _Interim Steering Committee_

The members of the _Interim Steering Committee_ are listed below. Each member of the _Interim Steering Committee_ also
nominate an alternate should they not be able to attend a meeting of the committee.
