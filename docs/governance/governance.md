# Project Governance

## 1. Guiding Principles
<!-- Optional section to state high-level principles like openness, meritocracy, consensus, etc. -->
The value of EESSI grows exponentially with two things: the amount of systems that make the EESSI software stack available, and the amount of software that is available in the EESSI software stack. Thus, the first goal of this governance is to make sure everyone in the community feels sufficiently included so that they are willing to contribute to EESSI (rather than build their own solution).

The second goal of this governance is to make clear how and by whom decisions in EESSI are taken. This is because trust in this process is important, both to infrastructure providers making the EESSI software stack is available on their systems, as well as by end-users of the software. Note that this concerns both large decisions, such as which architectures are supported in EESSI, as well as small decisions, such as whether to accept a certain contribution to add software to EESSI.

To achieve both goals, our governance is based on the meritocracy governance model.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities

Below, the roles and responsibilities related to the EESSI project are discussed. The group of people with a common role will be referred to as a Team in the remainder of this document. Each individual with a certain role will be referred to as a Team Member.

### 2.1 EESSI Github organization & repository owners
<!-- Define who contributors are and what they can do (e.g., file issues, submit PRs). -->
EESSI Github organization & repository owners are those individuals with `owner` rights on the EESSI Github organization or one of it's associated repositories.

EESSI Github organization & repository owners shall be responsible for setting permisssions on the code repositories, compliant to the defined roles and responsibilities. They are also responsible for managing Github Apps for the EESSI build bots.

### 2.2 EESSI Github organization & repository maintainers
EESSI Github organization & repository maintainers are individuals with write access on (one or more of) the EESSI Github repositories.

EESSI Github organization & repository maintainers shall be responsible for reviewing and merging PRs.

### 2.3 EESSI Infrastructure maintainers
EESSI Infrastructure maintainers are those individuals that maintain the EESSI CVMFS Stratum 0, one of the _public_ EESSI CVMFS Stratum 1's, build infrastructure (hosting the EESSI build bot) and the SMEE server.

Infrastructure maintainers shall be responsible for monitoring and maintaining their respective infrastructure, and provide access to those who needed it according to the Roles and Responsibilities described here. Note that maintainers of build infrastructure have the right to limit access to a _subset_ of the Builders and Deployers as described in 2.4 and 2.5 if they so desire.

### 2.4 Builders
Builders are those individuals that have permissions to build software for one or more of the EESSI build bots.

Builders are responsible for triggering builds for contributors who want to add software to the EESSI software stack. They are also responsible for checking the PR, so as to avoid execution of malicious code on the EESSI build infrastructure.

### 2.5 Deployers
Deployers are those individuals that have permissions to deploy software for one or more of the EESSI build bots. These individuals also have merge permissions on the `EESSI/staging` repository.

Deployers are responsible for checking the produced tarballs, through the reports generated by the build bot (as part of the build step), as well as through checking the reports uploaded by the Stratum 0 in `EESSI/staging` PRs. They should ensure that the tarballs do not contain anything unexpected / malicious.

### 2.6 Contributors

Contributors are individuals that make a pull request to one of the repositories in the EESSI Github organization.

Contributors that add software are responsible for checking that the license of the software they want to add allows it's use in EESSI (e.g. allows redistribution). Contributors are also responsible for making sure their PRs don't add any malicious code.

### 2.7 System administrators of systems providing EESSI

System administrators of systems providing EESSI are administrators of systems (such as, but not limited to cloud and HPC systems) that make the EESSI software stack available to their users.

System administrators of systems providing EESSI are responsible for making sure that their system does not put any disproportional load on the public EESSI CernVM-FS infrastructure. In practice, this means that they are responsible for provisioning proper caching for their system, such as a private CernVM-FS Stratum 1, a proxy, and/or a properly sized local cache.

### 2.8 End-Users

End-Users are individuals that use any of the software provided by the EESSI software stack.


## 3. Decision-Making

This section applies to the decision making procedure for the Teams discussed in Section 2. The Steering Committee has its own Decision-Making procedure. 

### 3.1 Consensus Seeking
<!-- Describe how decisions are reached: rough consensus, lazy consensus, etc. -->
Decisions are made by seeking consensus. It is up to each individual to judge if something is controversial enough so that it needs to be discussed with their Team. If so, they should bring it up through the agreed-upon channels (see Section 4).

### 3.2 Voting
<!-- Detail when voting is used, who can vote, quorum rules, and thresholds. -->
There is no formal voting for Teams, for two reasons:
1. The Teams may be too big to organize voting in a quick, practical way.
2. The obligation to take part in votes may discourage people to become part of these Teams, as it may be seen as a burden.

Voting may nonetheless be used as a way to achieve consensus. For example, asking (a relevant subset of) the Team to vote may be one way to determine the majority opinion. Then, it can be discussed if the majority vote is an acceptable outcome to the Team. If so, consensus is achieved.

### 3.3 Conflict Resolution
<!-- Define how disputes are escalated and resolved. -->
If consensus cannot be reached within the Team, the Steering Committee can take the decision for them. This can be requested by the Team, or done at the initiative of the Steering Committee (if the Steering Committee feels such a decision is needed to move the project forward).

Also, if multiple Teams claim ownership over an issue, the Steering Committee can decide which Team is allowed to decide over the issue.

### 3.4 Overturning decisions
<!-- Steering committee overruling a group? -->
The goal is for Teams to operate autonomously as much as possible. 

However, the Steering Committee _can_ overrule a decision made by any of the Teams. This power should only be used as a last resort, in exceptional cases. Examples of when this may be considered is if the Steering Committee feels that a decision endangers the integrity or sustainability of the project, or goes against the policies the Steering Committee has defined. Even then, the Steering Committee should first engage in a discussion with a Team to see if consensus can be achieved on changing the decision.

## 4. Meetings and Communication
<!-- Define how and where the team communicates, and how meetings (if any) are run. -->
While each Team is allowed to use the communication channels that their Team jointly agrees upon, the following channels are suggested
- GitHub / GitLab issues
- Slack
- (Periodic or incidental) video calls

## 5. Onboarding and Offboarding

### 5.1 Adding Team Members
<!-- Describe the process for adding new members. -->
Teams decide themselves how large their teams should ideally be. They also decide the procedure to add new Team members.

As with all decisions the decision to add a Team member is subject to article 3.4.

### 5.2 Removal
<!-- Describe under what conditions someone may be removed (e.g., inactivity, conduct). -->
Teams decide themselves decide the procedure to remove new Team members.

As with all decisions, the decision to remove a Team member is subject to article 3.4.

## 6 Steering committte
### 6.1 Responsibilities

The Steering Committee shall be responsible for:
- Setting the technical direction of the EESSI project and identifying key technical priorities
- Conflict resolution: if there is a conflict between the people with the aforementioned roles, the steering committee shall mediate the dispute and make a final decision if consensus cannot be reached
- The EESSI Charter (`charter.md`)
- The EESSI Governance (`governance.md`)
- The EESSI Policies (`policies.md`)

### 6.2 Members and Chairs

The Steering Committee is made up of community members with sustained and recognized contributions over time. Members take part in the Steering Committee as private individuals (i.e. they do not represent their employer(s)).

Members will be removed from the committee if they resign. Furthermore, if a Member is inactive (i.e. does not participate in any of the Steering Committee Meetings for 6 months), the Member may be voted out by the other Steering Committee members.

New Members are recommended by the Steering Committee. The Steering Committee will make the recommendation known to the community, and collect feedback on the recommendation. The Steering Committee then weighs the feedback, and votes on whether to accept the new member. In the selection process, the Steering Committee will consider the following:
- The Steering Committee should ideally consist of an odd number of Members
- No more than 30% of the Members should be employed by commercial entities

<!-- are there additional constraints we want to set? -->

<!-- By appointment is not unusual, see https://docs.clearlydefined.io/docs/community/charter#members-and-chairs -->

All new members will appoint an alternate that may represent them and vote on their behalf in case they are unavailable.

A Chair will be appointed by the Steering Committee to serve for a one-year term.

### 6.3 Voting by the Steering Committee

General decisions are taken by majority vote, provided that at least 75% of the Members cast a vote. Votes can be cast either in person, participating electronically, or via electronic vote (such as by e-mail). Members can cast a neutral vote, in which case the vote does count towards the quorum of 75%, but is not including in calculating the majority. Example: in a committee with 7 members, if 3 members vote in favour of a proposal, 2 votes against, and one votes neutral, the quorum is met (6 out of 7 members have voteded, i.e. >75%), and the majority (3 out of 5 non-neutral votes) is in favour, so the proposal is accepted.

In case of a tie, the issue is discussed again, and a second vote is taken. All Members that voted in the first round need to have the opportunity to vote in the second round, which may mean that the vote needs to be postponed to a next meeting (e.g. because someone voted by e-mail, prior to the meeting).

In case the quorum of 75% is not reached, the vote is postponed to a subsequent meeting.

Anything may be brought to a vote during the meeting. However, if known up-front, issues that need to be voted on are announced at least one week prior to the meeting, to give Members the opportunity to cast an Electronic vote if they cannot attend.

To amend the Charter or Governance, a two-thirds majority of all Steering Committee Members needs to be in favour of the amendment. This is irrespective of the number of Members who have actually cast a vote, or are present at the meeting. There is no quorum for votes on ammendments to the Charter or Governance.

### 6.4 Meetings

The Steering Committee will meet as needed, but at least four times a year. The Chair is responsible for organizing the meeting. Any Member can request the Chair to organize a meeting. Meetings are announced at least 2 weeks in advance, unless all Members have agreed that a meeting on shorter notice is required.
