**Effective Date:** 04 August 2025

By using the [**European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (EESSI)**](https://eessi.io), you agree to the following terms:

## 1. Purpose  
EESSI provides a shared scientific software stack for academic, research, and educational use. While access and usage are primarily intended for non-commercial scientific computing, commercial use is permitted.

## 2. Acceptable Use  
Users must act responsibly when accessing and using the EESSI infrastructure and software. In particular:

- Do not overload or abuse the public EESSI mirror servers. Avoid excessive or automated requests that may disrupt service availability for other users.  
- Use caching mechanisms where possible, and coordinate large-scale usage (e.g., automated deployments or CI pipelines) with the EESSI maintainers if in doubt.  
- Refrain from unauthorized access, modification, or redistribution of software components outside the permitted licensing terms.

Responsible use helps ensure reliable access for the entire scientific community.

## 3. Licensing  
All software within EESSI is governed by its respective open-source or institutional license. Users must adhere to these licenses; EESSI does not override or alter them.

## 4. Data Collection  
Basic telemetry or usage data may be collected for monitoring and improvement of the project. This is handled in accordance with the **GDPR** and relevant EU data protection standards.

## 5. No Guarantees  
EESSI is provided "as-is". Availability, performance, or correctness of the software stack is not guaranteed. Use is at your own risk.

## 6. Liability  
The EESSI maintainers and affiliated institutions are not liable for damages or losses arising from use of the software stack.

## 7. Contributions and Collaboration  
Contributions are welcome and governed by the project’s contribution guidelines. By contributing, you agree your input may be publicly shared and reused under compatible open-source licenses.
