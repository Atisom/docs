# `dev.eessi.io` repository

## What is `dev.eessi.io`?

`dev.eessi.io` is the development repository of EESSI. With it, developers can build and deploy non-production ready versions of their software to a CernVM-FS repository. 
This way, development version can easily be tested on systems where `dev.eessi.io` is available.

On a system with `dev.eessi.io` mounted access is possible with `module use /cvmfs/dev.eessi.io/versions/2023.06/modules/all`. Then, all that is left is
try out the development software!
