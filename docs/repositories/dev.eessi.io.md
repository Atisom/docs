# Development repository (`dev.eessi.io`)

## What is `dev.eessi.io`?

`dev.eessi.io` is the development repository of EESSI. With it, developers can deploy pre-release builds of their software to EESSI. 
This way, development versions of software can easily be tested on systems where the `dev.eessi.io` CernVM-FS repository is available.

On a system with `dev.eessi.io` mounted access is possible with `module use /cvmfs/dev.eessi.io/versions/2023.06/modules/all`. Then, all that is left is
try out the development software!

## Question or problems

If you have any questions regarding EESSI, or if you experience a problem in accessing or using it,
please [open a support request](../support.md). If you experience issues with the development repository, feel free to use the #dev.eessi.io channel 
of the EESSI Slack.
