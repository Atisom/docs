**What if you no longer have to install a broad range of scientific software from
scratch on every laptop, HPC cluster, or cloud instance you use or maintain,
without compromising on performance?**

The European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (EESSI, [https://eessi.io](https://eessi.io)) comes to the rescue!

In this webinar series we will provide a comprehensive overview of EESSI: why we started it, how it works, how you can use it, ...

## Session details

### Introduction to EESSI

- Monday 5 May 2025, 13:30-15:30 CEST (Zoom webinar)
- speakers:
    - Richard Topuchain (University of Bergen)
    - Helena Vela (Do IT Now)
- moderators:
    - Thomas Röblitz (University of Bergen)
    - Kenneth Hoste (Ghent University)

#### Outline

Discover how EESSI (European Environment for Scientific Software Installation) is transforming
the way scientific software is deployed and shared across HPC systems, cloud platforms, and even laptops.

In this session, we'll introduce the motivation behind EESSI, its architecture, and how you can start using
a fully pre-built, modular software environment — no matter where you compute. Whether you're an HPC user,
sysadmin, or developer, this webinar will show how EESSI can help you save time, improve reproducibility,
and simplify your scientific workflows.

### Introduction to CernVM-FS

- Monday 12 May 2025, 13:30-15:30 CEST (Zoom webinar)
- speakers:
    - Valentin Volkl (CERN)
    - Kenneth Hoste (Ghent University)

#### Outline

CernVM-FS, the CernVM File System a.k.a. CVMFS (https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs), is a file distribution service
that is particularly well suited to distribute software installations across a large number of systems world-wide
in an efficient way.

In this webinar, we will introduce you to CernVM-FS, show how to access existing CernVM-FS repositories (like [EESSI](https://eessi.io),
cover some aspects specific to using CernVM-FS on HPC systems.

It is intended for people with a background in HPC (system administrators, support team members, end users, etc.) who are new to CernVM-FS:
no specific prior knowledge or experience with it is required.

- Monday 19 May 2025, 13:30-15:30 CEST
- speakers:
    - Kenneth Hoste (Ghent University)

#### Outline

EasyBuild (https://easybuild.io) is a open-source software installation tool written in Python that aims to support
the various installation procedures used by the vast collection of software packages that are typically installed from source code
in an HPC environment.

In this webinar, we will introduce you to EasyBuild, show to install and configure it, and present basic usage through
hands-on demos. We will also cover some new capabilities that are supported by the recently released EasyBuild v5.0.0.
