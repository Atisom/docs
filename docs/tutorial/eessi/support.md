    *(30 April 2025)*

    The contents of this tutorial are currently being reworked to be up-to-date with recent developments in CernVM-FS,
    and to be well integrated in the EESSI documentation.

    It is based on the *"Best Practices for CernVM-FS in HPC"* tutorial that was held on
    4 Dec 2023, see also https://multixscale.github.io/cvmfs-tutorial-hpc-best-practices.
