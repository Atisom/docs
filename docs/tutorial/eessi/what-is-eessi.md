!!! danger "Work in progress"

    *(30 April 2025)*

    The contents of this tutorial are currently being reworked to be up-to-date with recent developments in CernVM-FS,
    and to be well integrated in the EESSI documentation.

    It is based on the *"Best Practices for CernVM-FS in HPC"* tutorial that was held on
    4 Dec 2023, see also https://multixscale.github.io/cvmfs-tutorial-hpc-best-practices.


# What is EESSI? 

The [European Environment for Scientific Software Installations](https://www.eessi.io) (EESSI, pronounced as "easy")
is a collaboration between different European partners in the HPC (High Performance Computing) community.

EESSI provides a common stack of *optimized* scientific software installations that work on any Linux distribution,
and currently supports both `x86_64` (AMD/Intel) and `aarch64` (Arm 64-bit) systems, which is distributed
via [CernVM-FS](../cvmfs/what-is-cvmfs.md).
